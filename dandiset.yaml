description: The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
  function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
  advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
  microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
  silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
  and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is the
  first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords compliancy
  to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent permitting simultaneous
  optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal activity. The SiMNA is
  used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous and evoked field potentials
  and of single unit activity in chronically implanted mice for up to 196 days in
  response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli. Significantly, the 1024-channel
  SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping of broadband brain activity in
  rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA with its multimodal capability
  and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will accelerate the progress in fundamental
  neurophysiological investigations and establishes a new milestone for penetrating
  and large area coverage microelectrode arrays for brainâ€“machine interfaces.
